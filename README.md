# [Your Python Project Title]

> A one-sentence description of what your Python script or project does.

## 📖 About The Project

A more detailed description of your project.
* What problem does it solve? (e.g., "This script automates...")
* Why did you build it? (e.g., "I wanted to practice web scraping with Python.")
* What did you learn?

## 🛠️ Built With

* **[Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)**
* [List any key Python libraries you used, e.g., Pandas, Flask, Requests, etc.]

## 🚀 Getting Started

This section explains how another person can get your project running on their own computer.

### Prerequisites

What things does the user need to have installed *before* they can use your code?
* **Python 3.x** must be installed.
* **pip** (Python's package installer) should be available.

### Installation

Give the step-by-step process to get the project running.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
3.  **Install the required packages:**
    *(This is a very important step for Python projects!)*

    First, you should create a `requirements.txt` file in your project by running this command in your terminal:
    ```sh
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    Then, anyone (including you) can install all the needed libraries in one go:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If your script doesn't need any special libraries, you can just say: "No special libraries are required.")*

## 💻 Usage

Explain how to use your script. Show a simple example.

**Example:**
To run the main script from your terminal:
```sh
python [your_main_script_name.py]
